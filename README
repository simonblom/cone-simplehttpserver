This is my solution to a project in Computer Networking 7.5 c,
it is to be used for demonstrative purposes only.

It is a simple HTTP server.

Build instructions for Linux
============================

To build the program, open a terminal, navigate to
the directory and type:

	java -jar pyttewebb.jar


Build instructions for Windows
==============================
To build the program, open a command prompt, navigate to
the directory and type:

	java -jar pyttewebb.jar


Build instructions for OS X (experimental)
==========================================

Should be roughly the same procedure as for Linux.

Since I am not a Mac user (or have access to Macs), I will
only provide limited support for this platform.
